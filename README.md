# ALDA Placement Optimizer

Analog-IC block placement engine for the `gpdk090` (90 nm) technology.
Generates blocks (random or from a SPICE netlist), then optimizes their 2D arrangement
(`B*-tree` / `Sequence Pair` topologies, Simulated Annealing, ILP, PSO) under symmetry constraints.
Includes a PyQt6 viewer with DRC checking, routing via MAGICAL Anaroute, and GDS export.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.9+. Gurobi (free academic licence) is required for ILP-based optimizers — all other topologies work without it.

## Run the optimizer

```bash
cd WorkDir/scripts

# Default — try every topology/optimizer combo and rank results
python main.py

# From a SPICE netlist
python main.py --netlist "../#Netlists/a11_five_transistor_ota.sp" --seed 42

# Single topology/optimizer pair
python main.py --run-mode user --topology BStarTopology --optimizer SimulatedAnnealingOptimizer

# Skip the Anaroute routing stage
python main.py --no-routing
```

### CLI flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--seed INT` | `42` | Random seed passed to every pipeline stage |
| `--num-blocks INT` | `15` | Number of transistor blocks to generate (ignored when `--netlist` is set) |
| `--netlist PATH` | — | Path to a SPICE `.sp` netlist; activates netlist-driven block generation (stage 011) instead of random generation (stage 001) |
| `--run-mode` | `exhaustive` | `random` — one random combo; `exhaustive` — all combos ranked; `user` — specify topology + optimizer explicitly |
| `--topology CLASS` | — | Required when `--run-mode user`. Available: `BStarTopology`, `SequencePairTopology`, `ILPTopology`, `PSOTopology` |
| `--optimizer CLASS` | — | Required when `--run-mode user`. Available: `SimulatedAnnealingOptimizer`, `ILPOptimizer`, `PSOOptimizer`, `BStarILPOptimizer`, `PSOILPOptimizer` |
| `--version TAG` | `v01` | Version suffix appended to all output JSON filenames |
| `--no-routing` | false | Skip stage 201 (Anaroute) even when `RUN_ROUTING = True` in the config block |

Output JSON → `WorkDir/json_files/`, logs → `WorkDir/logs/`.

## Viewer

The viewer is a PyQt6 GUI for inspecting placements, running simulations, checking DRC, routing, and exporting GDS.

### Launch

```bash
# Empty viewer
python WorkDir/viewer/main.py

# Open a placement file directly
python WorkDir/viewer/main.py --input WorkDir/json_files/s42_n15_py101_v01.json

# Headless DRC check — no GUI (exit 0 = clean, 1 = violations, 2 = error)
python WorkDir/viewer/main.py \
    --input WorkDir/json_files/s42_n15_py101_v01.json \
    --drc   WorkDir/myPDK/gpdk090_device_rules.json
```

### Run a simulation — Tools → Simulate Circuit

1. Open the viewer (**without** a file, or with an existing one for reference).
2. Choose **Tools → Simulate Circuit**.
3. Set the seed, number of blocks (or point to a netlist), run mode, and topology/optimizer combination.
4. Click **Run** — the optimizer executes and the resulting placement loads automatically into the viewer.

### Check DRC — Tools → DRC Check

1. Load a placement JSON that contains a placement result (stage 101 or later).
2. Open **Tools → DRC Check**.
3. Confirm the PDK rules path (`WorkDir/myPDK/gpdk090_device_rules.json`) and click **Run DRC**.
4. Violations appear in the list and are highlighted on the canvas; click any entry to zoom to it.

### Run routing — Tools → Route Placement

> **Warning:** Docker Desktop must be running before starting a simulation or routing. If the Docker engine is not started, the routing stage will fail with exit code 127. Start Docker Desktop from the Start Menu and wait until the whale icon in the system tray stops animating before proceeding.

Requires the MAGICAL Docker image (`magical_szaboga1_dev_wmi:latest`) to be running locally.

1. Load a placed py101 JSON.
2. Open **Tools → Route Placement** — Anaroute runs in the background and the routed result (py201) loads automatically.

### Export GDS — Tools → Export GDS

1. Load any placement JSON (routing is not required).
2. Open **Tools → Export GDS**.
3. Adjust GDS layer assignments if needed, set the output path, and click **Export GDS**.
4. Enable **Open in KLayout (WSL)** to preview the layout immediately after export.
